      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>send an email to <%= link_to "sponsor@wifi.service.gov.uk", "mailto:sponsor@wifi.service.gov.uk" %></li>
        <li>leave the subject line blank</li>
        <li>only include the email address of each visitor on separate lines within the email</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
       
       <p>Once this has been done, you will receive an email containing your GovWifi username and password.</p> 
       <p>If you do not receive the username and password confirmation e-mail within a few minutes of signing up, please check your spam/junk e-mail folder.</p>
